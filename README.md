# ComputerProjectES102

The name of computer projrct is Hand Cricket. This is the computer version of our favourite Hand Cricket.
I have used random and default python libraries for coding this game.
The game takes the username as its first input. then the second input is the runs which the user wants to select. The code then runs the logical sequence and gives out the output.
There are safety conditions also which prevent compiler from blowing up and giving error for wrong/void inputs given by the user while playing the game.

The references taken for writing this programme are as follows:
GeeksForGeeks
Stackoverflow
pythontutor
and YouTube.
